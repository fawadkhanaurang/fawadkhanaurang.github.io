    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
      I am Dr. Muhammad Fawad Khan, a Research Assistant in Artificial Intelligence, Optimization, and Rehabilitation Robotics at School of Information Technology and Systems, University of Canberra, Australia. My academic and professional journey is deeply rooted in the integration of intelligent systems with real-world dynamics, where I aim to bridge the gap between data-driven algorithms and physical, biomechanical environments. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, biomechanical modeling, soft computing, and neuro-mechanical control, with a focus on applications that support healthcare, human performance, and robotics.
Currently, I am working on that how AI techniques can be applied to human-centric systems. Our work primarily focuses on upper-limb rehabilitation robotics, reinforcement learning-based control strategies, and intelligent modeling of musculoskeletal systems using real-time sensor data. I have also contributed significantly to the development of physics-informed learning frameworks, particularly in complex fluid dynamics and heat transfer modeling, using hybrid optimization algorithms. I am particularly interested in multimodal learning models that integrate sensor data, biomechanics, and contextual information to enable more accurate and adaptive human-centered AI systems.
My scholarly contributions include over Q1-ranked journal publications spanning fields such as biomechanics, fluid mechanics, and intelligent systems. I’ve worked on modeling Casson fluid flows influenced by electromagnetic effects, developed hybrid neural-soft computing models, and led studies in trajectory optimization for both vehicles and robotic limbs. My work is multidisciplinary by nature and has found relevance across engineering, healthcare, and emerging AI applications.
Beyond technical contributions, I value collaboration and open science. I frequently engage with clinical researchers, engineers, and data scientists to co-develop solutions that are not only accurate but also practical and ethically grounded. I’m committed to making AI accessible and responsible whether it’s through transparent model development, sharing reproducible code, or mentoring students in cutting-edge technologies.
What motivates me is the ability to make a meaningful impact whether it’s by helping a stroke patient regain mobility, enhancing the training of elite athletes, or solving complex real-time optimization problems in robotics and energy systems. I believe that the fusion of AI, biomechanics, and human data holds transformative potential for the future, and I’m excited to be working at the forefront of this evolution.
